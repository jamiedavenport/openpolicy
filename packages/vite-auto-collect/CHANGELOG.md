## 0.0.19

### Patch Changes

- 165ae2e: Add `thirdParty()` auto-collect support. Call `thirdParty(name, purpose, policyUrl)` next to the code that uses a third-party service; the `autoCollect` Vite plugin now scans these calls and populates the `thirdParties` sentinel exported from `@openpolicy/sdk`.
- 165ae2e: Add `usePackageJson` option to `autoCollect()` that cross-references `package.json` dependencies against a built-in registry of known npm packages (Stripe, Sentry, PostHog, Datadog, and ~12 others) to auto-populate `thirdParties` without requiring source-code annotations. Explicit `thirdParty()` calls always take precedence over auto-detected entries.

## 0.0.18

### Patch Changes

- 82e7df7: Add `autoCollected` sentinel to `@openpolicy/sdk` and new `@openpolicy/vite-auto-collect` Vite plugin that scans source files for `collecting()` calls and inlines the discovered categories into the sentinel at build time. Spread `autoCollected` into `dataCollected` in your `openpolicy.ts` — the plugin composes cleanly without requiring `@openpolicy/vite`.
